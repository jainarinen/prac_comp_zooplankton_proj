# prac_comp_zooplankton_proj
This is a final project for practical computing

Task 1:Create code to correctly calculate zooplankton density

Open files in this order:

1. EcoTaxa_read (r Project)
2. sp051221we (txt)
3. exotaxa_read_template (RMD) -- This is the file that explains what each block of code does.

These calculations were compared to my manual calculations in excel from a previous sample (sp051221we.txt) ... they matched... SUCCESS
The point of task 1 was to make a script to use for all other txt files.

Task 2: Use code above (exotaxa_read_template) to calculate zooplankton and detritus volumes from before, during, and after dredging at station WA

Open files in this order:

1. EcoTaxa_read (r Project)

2. sp51121wa (txt)
3. sp_wa_before (RMD)

4. sp61421wa (txt)
5. sp_wa_during (RMD)

6. sp71021wa (txt)
7. sp_wa_after (RMD)

All of the RMD files in Task 2 were based off of the "exotaxa_read_template.RMD". There were slight changes that had to be made based on issues with some of the txt files. This was always annoated. 

Task 3: Use code above to compare zooplankton and detritus volumes from before, during, and after dredging at station WA

run all code from *2-7 in Task 2* within the Ecotaxa_Read project.

8. wa_comparisons (RMD)

This will generate graphs from objects created in the previous RMD files (sp_wa_before, sp_wa_during, sp_wa_after)
